## Technologies Used

- **JAMstack:** The project follows JAMstack principles, delivering fast, secure, and scalable sites using JavaScript, APIs, and pre-rendered Markup.
- **Next.js:** A popular React-based framework for building server-side rendered (SSR) and statically generated websites and applications.
- **TypeScript:** A superset of JavaScript that adds optional static typing and other features to improve the development experience.
- **ESLint:** A static code analysis tool used to flag suspicious code and enforce coding standards.
- **Prettier:** A code formatter that automatically formats code to a consistent style.
- **Vitest:** A fast unit testing framework for JavaScript applications.
- **CSS Modules:** A CSS file in which all class names and animation names are scoped locally by default.
- **SASS:** A CSS preprocessor that adds power and elegance to the basic language, used for more maintainable stylesheets.
- **Markdown:** Used for blog content and documentation, with [gray-matter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gray-matter) for frontmatter parsing and [markdown-to-jsx](https://www.npmjs.com/package/markdown-to-jsx) for rendering Markdown as React components.
- **RSS Feed:** The [`rss`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rss) library is used to generate an RSS feed for blog posts, improving discoverability and syndication.
- **next-sitemap:** Automatically generates a sitemap for SEO optimization.
- **@fortawesome/react-fontawesome:** Provides scalable vector icons for UI.
- **@next/bundle-analyzer:** A tool for visualizing the size of output files with an interactive zoomable treemap.  
  _Run `npm run analyze` to generate a bundle report after building._
- **Jest DOM & Testing Library:** For improved assertions and React component testing.
- **Serve:** Used to serve the static build output locally.
- **Wrangler:** For managing Cloudflare Workers (if used for deployment or edge functions).
